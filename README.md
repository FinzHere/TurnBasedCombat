# RPG GAME
Hi! This is my ongoing project of a simple turn-based game, a bit like pokemon, in python! Hope you enjoy!


## Some Info
This game is nowhere near complete. This is just the start, and I wanna work on it for a while and add new things like status effects, weapons, armor, spells and many more items! This is a passion project though, nothing more. Don't expect super fast progress, but I will be working on it.

## How to install
There are currently no releases. If you want to play, go to the green "<>Code" button and click "Download ZIP". Once this is downloaded, extract it to a file of your choosing. You HAVE to put main.py and enemies.py into the same folder, and I would recommend putting these two into a seperate file so they don't get mixed up with other files. Also put the items folder into the same folder as main.py and enemies.py.

If the game is working, it will say beneath this line

## STATUS: NOT YET, NEARLY!

Make sure to keep your game up to date!

I hope you enjoy this project!
